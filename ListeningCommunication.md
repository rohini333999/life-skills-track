## Question 1

## What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

### 1. Focus on the intent and purpose of the conversation.

Active listening begins with an intent to be conscious and receptive to the other person.Being mindful generally means being respectful and aware of the present moment. No daydreaming, no interrupting, and no thinking about what you're going to say in response

### 2. Pay attention to body language.

Much of communication relies on the nonverbal.can include facial expressions, posture, hand gestures, eye contact or movement, and touch. When listening to others, consider what your body language says

### 3. Clarify and paraphrase information

In the workplace, you might have doubts about whether your mind grasped the full picture. Clarifying and paraphrasing the information back to the speaker can help both of you fill in any gaps in understanding.

### 4. Ask questions

As an active listener, you can also demonstrate interest by asking questions. Asking an open-ended question can encourage the speaker to elaborate on an important or interesting idea. It also shows that you have been listening attentively up to that point, and you want to know more. This can nurture a bond between the speaker and listener.

### 5. Refrain from judgment

When practicing active listening, it is important to remain open, neutral, and nonjudgmental. What’s so wonderful about taking the steps to become a better listener is that you can engage with new ideas, perspectives, and opportunities that you may never have accessed previously.

### 6. Summarize, share, and reflect

Toward the end of your interaction, make sure you end on a high note. Share a quick summary or a few notes about what the speaker said. In informal settings, sharing thoughts and feelings may lead to deeper and meaningful conversations. After the interaction, reflect on what you learned.

## Question 2

### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

- Reflective listening is hearing and understanding, and then letting the other know that he or she is being heard and understood.
- When you can answer the question, “What is going on with this person right now?” and have your answer verified, then you are listening with precision.
- Reflective listening can help the speaker achieve his or her outcomes.
- Also, the communication skills of problem solving, assertion, conflict management, and negotiation all require the extensive listening.
- Listening accurately to another person and reflecting the essence of both the content and the feelings the other has expressed.
- If the reflection is completely “off-target,” it diverts the conversation and takes the focus off the other.
- When reflecting on the words of the person speaking, keep their tone and other nonverbal clues in mind to create a reflection.
